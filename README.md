# OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) Demand Generation
This is a GitHub organization dedicated to generating demand around the OpenAPI specification and its community. It is in alignment with the OAI, but is meant to allow for a wider reach across the community, and increased level of involvement by non-members.

Things are just getting started, and you are encouraged to get involved to help increase awareness about what is possible with the OpenAPI specification, and the services and tooling built on top of them.

A couple ways you can get involved today:

- **Weekly Open Office Hours** - You can join in the conversation each week in the OAI DemandGen Open Office Hours, 8:00 AM Pacific time--just email [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) to get added to the invite.
- **GitHub Issues** - We are using GitHub issues to organize ideas, and activities around this work. Please submit a GitHub issue for any question or idea you might have, or just email [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) for private channel.
- **[Event Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Y29vOGVqZGluMjFqdGoxajBzZ2dhOXR1b29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)** - This is the public calendar for all events that are happening as part of this effort, allowing for the wider community to participate.

Right now we are just in idea phase, but some of these projects are rapidly moving ahead, so stay in tune via issues, and we'll begin adding separate pages here to help track individual projects.

## Current issues

- [Ideas](https://github.com/oai-demandgen/home/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aideas) - Submit your ideas for what you think would help generate more demand for the OpenAPI spec.
