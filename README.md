# API Specification Toolbox
This is a GitHub organization dedicated to generating demand around API specification and the people, services, and tooling around them. Working independent of any organization or company to help drive attention and demand for common API specifications.

Things are just getting started, and you are encouraged to get involved to help increase awareness about what is possible with API specifications, and the services and tooling built on top of them.

A couple ways you can get involved today:

- **[Website](https://api.specificationtoolbox.com/)** - We now have a website you can visit to better understand what is happening as part of these API specification discussions.
- **Weekly Open Office Hours** - You can join in the conversation each week in the API Specification Toolbox Open Office Hours, 8:00 AM Pacific time--just email [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) to get added to the invite.
- **GitHub Issues** - We are using GitHub issues to organize ideas, and activities around this work. Please submit a GitHub issue for any question or idea you might have, or just email [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) for private channel.
- **[Event Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Y29vOGVqZGluMjFqdGoxajBzZ2dhOXR1b29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)** - This is the public calendar for all events that are happening as part of this effort, allowing for the wider community to participate.

Right now we are just in idea phase, but some of these projects are rapidly moving ahead, so stay in tune via issues, and we'll begin adding separate pages here to help track individual projects.
